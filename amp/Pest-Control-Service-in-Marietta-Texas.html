If you are at the supermarket, look for the little stickers more than a food.

You CAN wipe out Drywood Termites, Bed Bugs and a slew of other pests by using 'green' Pest Control. The "professionals'" don't i would love you to know this to ensure that spend large numbers of energy denouncing green pest control or every option it doesn't include items.
