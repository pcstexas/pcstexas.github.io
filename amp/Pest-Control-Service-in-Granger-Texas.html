Individuals that had dealt with similar ant problems suggested cinnamon, basil, garlic, along with other bitter leaves to be freed from of carpenter ants.

Sugar ants, or pavement ants, are small black ants. Their real name is Little Black Bugs. Black ants show up between March and November. Bay leaves and cloves help be rid of black helpless ants.
